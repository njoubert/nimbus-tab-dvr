# Nimbus Tab DVR: design interrogation

Questions raised against the shape of the project before research and planning.
Answer inline under each **Answer:** marker.
"Don't know" is a valid answer.

Sections are ordered by how much damage a wrong answer does.
A question that has been answered stays here with its answer, because the reason for a decision is worth more later than the decision is.

## 1. What it is

**1a.** What does "tab DVR" record: a browser tab's rendered video, its audio, the whole tab as a screen capture, or a stream it is playing?

**Answer:** The rendered video of one tab, composited, so a cross-origin iframe such as a YouTube embed is in the frame.
The tab's audio can be captured with it as an Opus track, shown by the spike on 2026-09-09; whether it is on by default is a deployment setting.
Not a screen capture and not a stream the tab is playing.

**1b.** Who is it for, and how many of them are there?

**Answer:** A client's web application, running on a managed macOS Chrome fleet whose size is not known yet.
The demo application in this repository stands in for it.
The repository is a handoff: the extension and the demo are here, the client's backend stays theirs.

**1c.** What does the user do with a recording once it exists?

**Answer:** Nothing, locally.
The extension uploads it to the client's backend, which remuxes the timesliced chunks into a seekable file.
The extension never has to produce a seekable file itself.

## 2. The load-bearing assumption

**2a.** Which capture interface is this built on, and does it give what the design needs on the platforms in scope?

**Answer:** `chrome.tabCapture.getMediaStreamId` from a Manifest V3 service worker, consumed by an offscreen document.
Proven by [the spike report](reports/2026-09-09-2343-capture-feasibility-spike.md): Chrome grants capture to a tab the user has invoked the extension on, or to an extension whose id Chrome was launched with as `--allowlisted-extension-id`, and nothing else lifts that.
One click per tab was accepted on 2026-09-09; the flag is the zero-click path where a launcher starts Chrome.
Decided 2026-09-10: for demo and development, Chrome is launched with the flag, which is what the test does; in deployment the fleet's Chrome is not launched with a flag, so a recording needs one invocation per tab.

**2b.** What happens when that interface is unavailable, denied by the user, or changed by a browser update?

**Answer:** A browser update changing the grant rule is a risk this project accepts and re-tests per Chrome release; the rule is one condition in `tab_capture_api.cc`.
If neither one click per tab nor a launcher passing `--allowlisted-extension-id` is acceptable to the client, the extension is the wrong shape, and the alternatives are a DevTools-protocol screencast of a controlled Chrome or a native capture of the Chrome window.

## 3. Shape and constraints

**3a.** Is this a browser extension, a native app, a service, or a library?

**Answer:** A Manifest V3 Chrome extension, plus a demo web application in the same repository that is the host during development.

**3b.** Which platforms and which versions, and which of those are actually tested?

**Answer:** Managed Chrome on macOS, installed through the admin console or Jamf.
The spike ran the pipeline on Playwright's Chromium 153.0.8010.12 and the packing and policy checks on Google Chrome 150.0.7871.101; the branded Chrome ignores `--load-extension`, so the pipeline on Chrome 150 itself is unverified until the extension reaches it by force-install or by hand.
Windows and ChromeOS are out of scope.

**3c.** What is the dependency budget, and what is the licence?

**Answer:** TypeScript, Vite and Playwright, plus the type-only packages `@types/chrome` and `@types/node`.
No formatter yet.
The licence is MIT.

## 4. Failure and scale

**4a.** How long is the longest recording it must survive, and what bounds the disk it uses?

**Answer:** Under one hour.
The spool bound is a safety net rather than a design driver, and it is not set in the spike.

**4b.** What is the acceptable loss when the process dies mid-recording?

**Answer:** Up to one timeslice plus what the encoder holds.
Measured on 2026-09-09: a killed offscreen document kept 4.93 of about 6 seconds at a two second timeslice.

## 5. Distribution

**5a.** How does a user install it, and how does it update itself?

**Answer:** Force-installed by policy on the managed fleet.
Chrome force-installs an extension that is not on the Chrome Web Store only on a machine it detects as enterprise managed, which on macOS means MDM enrolment; the spike recorded the refusal verbatim.
Decided 2026-09-10: the client pushes the extension with Jamf to its managed Chrome installs, so the machines are MDM-enrolled and the path is a self-hosted `.crx` and update manifest force-installed by policy, with the managed configuration alongside it.
The Web Store is not needed.
Updates come from the same update manifest.

**5b.** What is signed, notarized, or reviewed by a store, and who holds the credentials?

**Answer:** The `.crx` is signed with the RSA key in `.signing/nimbus-tab-dvr.pem`, whose public half is the `key` in the manifest and fixes the extension id `oibiheibjolbkmifdocjhkfalginaofm`.
Who holds it for the fleet, and whether a Web Store review is wanted, is the client's call.
